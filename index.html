            <h2>1856 – 1943</h2>
            <h3>One of the greatest inventors of humanity</h3>
            <p>Nikola Tesla (/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə; Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла, pronounced [nǐkola têsla]; 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.</p>

            <h3>The following list is a time line of Tesla life</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span>1856</span> - Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia).</li>
                <li><span>1861</span> - Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion.</li>
                <li><span>1862</span> - the Tesla family moved to the nearby Gospić, where Tesla's father worked as parish priest.</li>
                <li><span>1870</span> - Tesla moved to Karlovac to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual throughout schools within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.</li>
                <li><span>1873</span> - He finished a four-year term in three years.</li>
                <li><span>1875</span> - He enrolled at the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz on a Military Frontier scholarship.</li>
                <li><span>1881</span> - Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead.</li>
                <li><span>1882</span> - Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system.</li>
                <li><span>1884</span> - Tesla emigrated and began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 "field engineers" struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city. As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators. Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times.</li>
                <li><span>1885</span> - He met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents. Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company. Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey. Tesla's new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.</li>
                <li><span>1887</span> - Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission.</li>
                <li><span>1888</span> - There was even a "war of currents" propaganda campaign going on, with Edison Electric claiming their direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system and Thomson-Houston sometimes siding with Edison. Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla's motor and the related polyphase system right away.</li>
                <li><span>1889</span> - Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for the next dozen years worked out of a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan.</li>
                <li><span>1889</span> - Tesla traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich Hertz's experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves.</li>
                <li><span>1891</span> - Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In the same year, he patented his Tesla coil.</li>
                <li><span>1893</span> - At St. Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the National Electric Light Association, Tesla told onlookers that he was sure a system like his could eventually conduct "intelligible signals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires" by conducting it through the Earth.</li>
                <li><span>1893</span> - Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott and then Benjamin G. Lamme had made progress on an efficient version of Tesla's induction motor. Lamme found a way to make the polyphase system it would need compatible with older single-phase AC and DC systems by developing a rotary converter.</li>
                <li><span>1894</span> - Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of "invisible" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments</li>
                <li><span>1895</span> - the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire.</li>
                <li><span>1898</span> - Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed "telautomaton"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden.</li>
                <li><span>1899</span> - To further study the conductive nature of low-pressure air, Tesla set up an experimental station at high altitude in Colorado Springs. There he could safely operate much larger coils than in the cramped confines of his New York lab, and an associate had made an arrangement for the El Paso Power Company to supply alternating current free of charge.</li>
                <li><span>1901</span> - Tesla had expanded his plans to build a more powerful transmitter to leap ahead of Marconi's radio-based system, which Tesla thought was a copy of his own.</li>
                <li><span>1906</span> - Tesla demonstrated a 200 horsepower (150 kilowatts) 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine.</li>
                <li><span>1922</span> - He moved to the St. Regis Hotel and followed a pattern from then on of moving to a different hotel every few years and leaving unpaid bills behind.</li>
                <li><span>1937</span> - At the age of 81, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries was never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.</li>
                <li><span>1943</span> - At the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker.</li>
